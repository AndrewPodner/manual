# Creating Data Sources

## Introduction

If you're reading this guide, chances are you've looked around for a data source in the Lithium community but haven't yet found it. Whether it's LDAP or the Flickr API you want to connect to, you're in luck. This guide will guide you through the thinking and the process necessary to create your own data source. 

First, we'll discuss some of the overall architectural knowledge needed, then we'll dive into the details with a real example.

## Metadata Methods

When creating a data source, it's important to realize the role of a data source. Data sources provide a layer that assists models, but focuses on the details surrounding connecting to, authenticating, and facilitating generic reads and writes to a certain data store. When creating a data source, work on the generic tasks needed to get the work done rather than the domain-specific work models will perform later on.

As such, it's important for Lithium's models to understand the structure of the underlying data. A well-written data source should provide that information in a format models understand. 

There are two main data source methods you'll want to implement: `entities()` and `describe()`:

<table>
	<thead>
	<tr>
		<th>Method Name</th>
		<th>Question it Answers</th>
		<th>RDMBS Example</th>
		<th>NoSQL Example</th>
		<th>API/Service Example</th>
	</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
	<tr>
		<td>entities()</td>
		<td>What objects can models bind to?</td>
		<td>A list of tables in the database.</td>
		<td>A list of collections in the database.</td>
		<td>A list of objects manipulated by the API.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>describe()</td>
		<td>What properties does each entity have?</td>
		<td>What columns are in a given table, and what are their types?</td>
		<td>May only return an empty array, as the schema could be different between documents.</td>
		<td>Which properties are mutable/searchable on the objects in the API, and what type are they?</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

Focus on understanding the meaning behind these methods for nowâ€”we'll be implementing them and discussing the details as we create a real data source shortly.

## Queries and Entities

Once models understand the basic shape for your data, the next step is facilitating communication between the data source and its associated models.

In Lithium, models ask the data source questions through `Query` objects, and the data source answers with `Entity` objects, which are either a `Record` or a `Document`. For example, when a model is used in a controller to find data, it packages up a `Query` object that contains structured data about what sort of data the model is asking for, and in what order it expects it returned in. 

It passes this `Query` to the data source, which connects and authenticates to the data store. It inspects the query to see what the model needs, interacts with the underlying data store, and wraps the response data in some sort of `Entity`. If the response requires more than one `Entity`, it's usually wrapped up in a `Collection` like a `RecordSet` or `DocumentSet`.

Once the model has the `Entity`, it can provide that information back to the controller (or loop through it if it's in a collection).

## Example Data Source: GitHub Issues API

Let's dive into a real-life example of creating a data source. For the remainder of this guide, we'll walk through the process of creating a new data source that connects, authenticates, and moves data to and from the GitHub API. Version 2 of the GitHub API is available via a simple RESTful interface that uses HTTP authentication. We'll be setting up a new data source, using the existing `data\source\Http` class as a starting point.

### Setup

The end result we're looking for is being able to create models that read from and write to GitHub using our data source. Let's get started by creating the data source file and creating a connection to it. First, create a new file in `app/extensions/adapter/data/source/http/GitHub.php`:

{{{
<?php
namespace app\extensions\adapter\data\source\http;
class GitHub extends \lithium\data\source\Http {
}
?>
}}}

Let's also create a connection that uses this new data source. Add a few lines to `app/config/bootstrap/connections.php`:

{{{
<?php
Connections::add('github', array(
	'type'     => 'http',
	'adapter'  => 'GitHub',
	'login'    => 'myusername',
	'password' => '5up3Rs3CrE7',
	'token'    => 'e83fd93a7e099c8523ab99d003ce939a',
));
?>
}}}

Since the GitHub API allows for an API token to be passed instead of a password, we've added that to the connection information. 

Finally, we'll need to create a new model and controller to test the functionality as we build it:

{{{
<?php
namespace app\models;
class Issue extends \lithium\data\Model {
	public $_meta = array(
		'connection' => 'github'
	);
}
?>	
}}}

{{{
<?php
namespace app\controllers;
use app\models\Issue;
class IssuesController extends \lithium\action\Controller {
	public function index() {
	}
}
?>
}}}

### Connecting & Authentication

Now that we've got the basic classes in place, let's make sure that the model can connect to GitHub API correctly. Looking at the HTTP data source we're extending, you can see that the `\lithium\net\http\Service` object is created in the `_init()` method. By overriding that in our new data source, we'll be able to construct it with the options we want. Add this to the new data source:

{{{
<?php
protected function _init() {
	if(!empty($this->_config['token'])) {
		$password = '/token' . $this->_config['token'];
	} else {
		$password = $this->_config['password'];
	}
	
	$config = array(
		'scheme' => 'https',
		'host' => $this->_domain,
		'auth' => true,
		'username' => $this->_config['login'],
		'password' => $password,
	);
	$this->connection = $this->_instance('service', $config);
	parent::_init();
}
?>
}}}

What we're doing here is checking to see if there's a token related to the connection. If so, we use it and adjust the password field as noted on the GitHub API website. Otherwise, we feed the new `Service` object with the configuration options we need. As we make changes, we're using the `$_config` property of the data source, since that's where all the details for the connection have been stored.

_Note:_ The astute reader may notice the usage of the `_instance()` method. That's Lithium's straightforward and simple way of managing dependency injection. We'll cover this more later, but what it does is looks up the class listed in the `$_classes` property and instantiates it using the supplied configuration array. Using `_instance()` rather than manually instantiating classes allows your fellow developers to switch out classes on the fly with others they'd rather use. In this case, we're asking for the service class that's going to be making HTTP requests for the data source.
