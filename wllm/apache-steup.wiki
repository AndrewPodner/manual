There are many ways to set up apache to serve Lithium apps. We'll try to stick to the basics here.

The location of your Apache config file depends on your environment, but it usually goes by 'httpd.conf' or 'apache.conf'. Assuming you don't plan to use a virtual host (if you don't know what that means, you can safely assume you aren't), the _DocumentRoot_ directive should be set to \_your Lithium directory\_>/app: ```DocumentRoot "_your Lithium directory_>/app".```

Typically, you'll also have to loosen some restrictions on the home directory with some simple directives. The following is an example of a configuration that works for Lithium:

{{{
<Directory "_your Lithium directory_/app">
    # Basic directives to let Lithium do its thing
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks

    # Let our .htaccess file set any directive   
    AllowOverride all

    # Let anyone request resources from anywhere
    Allow from all
</Directory>
}}}

Note that this is **not** a good configuration for production servers. Make sure you know what you're doing before configuring Apache for production use.

At this point you should see the Lithium welcome page when you request 'http://localhost' in your browser.
