## Getting Lithium

Li3's source is housed in a Git repo. Start by creating a new account at http://rad-dev.org/users/add. Once you've successfully created your new account, add your SSH key at http://rad-dev.org/users/account. If you've never completed that process before, sometimes its as simple as typing in 'ssh-keygen' in a console.

	$ ssh-keygen
	
	Generating public/private rsa key pair.
	Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/lithium/.ssh/id_rsa): 
	Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
	Enter same passphrase again: 
	Your identification has been saved in /Users/lithium/.ssh/id_rsa.
	Your public key has been saved in /Users/lithium/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
	
Once the public key has been created, copy and paste it's contents into the Ssh Keys section of your account settings at rad-dev.org. 

Now that your key has been set up, clone yourself a copy of Li3 inside of your webserver's document root:

	$ cd /path/to/docroot
	$ git clone code@rad-dev.org:lithium.git
	
	Initialize lithium/.git
	Initialized empty Git repository in /path/to/docroot/lithium/.git/
	Identity added: /Users/lithium/.ssh/id_rsa (/Users/lithium/.ssh/id_rsa)

You'll be asked a password during this operation. Make sure to supply the same one you did when you created your SSH key.
