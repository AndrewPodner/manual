## Lithium on Apache

In order to provide Lithium applications with clean URLs, Lithium ships with a set of `.htaccess` files for use with Apache, which will handle URL rewriting.

By default, these files can be utilized by finding all references to `AllowOverride` in your `httpd.conf` configuration file and setting the values to `All`.

In production, it is recommended that you set `AllowOverride` to `None` and instead, create a `<VirtualHost />` configuration pointed at your application's `webroot` directory, which will contain the rewrite rules. For example, if your application is located in `/var/www/html/your_app`, your configuration would resemble the following:

{{{
<VirtualHost *:80>
	ServerName your-app.com
	DocumentRoot "/var/www/html/your_app/webroot"
	ErrorLog "logs/error_log"

	<Directory "/var/www/html/your_app/webroot">
		RewriteEngine On
		RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
		RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
		RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !favicon.ico$
		RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php?url=$1 [QSA,L]
	</Directory>
</VirtualHost>
}}}
